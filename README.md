# Connect_100
This was a project done in the fall of 2016 using a Freescale 9S12C32 microcontroller, an Arduino Uno, a VS1053 breakout board, and an audio amplifier to drive on-board speakers.  The goal of this project was to create an electronic version of Connect4 with the features of color customizable tokens, a variable difficulty opponent, win detection, and sound effects.  This was my mini project for ECE 362, I opted to be a team of one because I wanted to make sure I knew each step of development.  This repo was created now in response to my laptop dying with a lot of my old projects being erased, many of which had functions come up in later projects
